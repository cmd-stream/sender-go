A lightweight Go library for sending commands using a [cmd-stream](https://github.com/cmd-stream/cmd-stream-go) 
client group, with built-in support for hooks, deadlines, and multi-result 
handling.

It proides a high-level abstraction over the following code:
```go
import (
  grp "github.com/cmd-stream/cmd-stream-go/group"
  core "github.com/cmd-stream/sender-go"
)

var (
  group grp.ClientGroup = ...
  results chan core.AsyncResult = ...
)
seq, clientID, n, err := group.Send(cmd, results)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
select {
case <-ctx.Done():
  group.Forget(seq, clientID)
  err = ErrTimeout
case asyncResult := <-results:
  result = asyncResult.Result
  err = asyncResult.Error
}
```

## Usage Examples
Here are just a few lines of code to show typical usage:
```go
// Send one Command, receive one Result.
result, err := sender.Send(ctx, cmd) // ctx allows canceling if the wait takes too long

// Send a Command with a deadline.
result, err := sender.SendWithDeadline(ctx, cmd, deadline)

// Send one Command, receive multiple Results.
var resultHandler ResultHandlerFn = func(result core.Result, err error) error { 
  // handle each result here
  return nil
}
err := sender.SendMulti(ctx, cmd, resultsCount, resultHandler) 
// resultsCount defines the number of expected Results

// Send a Command with a deadline, receive multiple Results.
err := sender.SendMultiWithDeadline(ctx, cmd, resultsCount, resultHandler)
```

More detailed examples can be found at [examples-go](https://github.com/cmd-stream/cmd-stream-examples-go).

For special cases, you can implement your own sender, itâ€™s not hard to do.

## Hooks
sender-go also supports hooks, allowing you to customize behavior during the send
process. Hooks can be used for logging, instrumentation, circuit breaker
integration, and more. They are provided through a `HooksFactory`, which creates 
a fresh `Hooks` instance for each send operation. This ensures isolation and 
flexibility for each request.

The `hooks` package already includes ready-to-use implementations like
`CircuitBreakerHooks` and `NoopHooks`.
